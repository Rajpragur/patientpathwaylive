To make sure you’re expelling all the air you can, practice making a whooshing sound as you breathe out.\n• Close your mouth and inhale gently through your nose while mentally counting a slow 1 - 2 - 3 - 4. Aim for a comfortable inflation of the lungs using the belly muscles. If you find your shoulders hunching, relax and try to manage the incoming breath with your belly muscles.\n• Hold the breath for a slow 7 count.\n• Exhale through your mouth while mentally counting to 8. Make the whoosh sound to be sure you’re exhaling completely.\n\nThis is one 4 – 7 – 8 breathing cycle! *Repeat the same 4-step sequence 3 more times.\n\nFor many people, the relaxation and the increased intake of air that take place in these four breath cycles will calm their minds and nourish their blood oxygen so thoroughly that they fall asleep before the cycles are complete!\n\nHaving trouble breathing through your nose?
