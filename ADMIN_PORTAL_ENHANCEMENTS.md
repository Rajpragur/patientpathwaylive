## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface DoctorProfile {
  id: string;
  clinic_name: string | null;
  first_name: string | null;
  last_name: string | null;
  email: string | null;
  location: string | null;
  specialty: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  user_id: string;
}

interface QuizLead {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string | null;
  phone: string | null;
  quiz_type: string;
  score: number;
  lead_status: string | null;
  lead_source: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  doctor_id: string;
  scheduled_date: string | null;
}
```

### Lead Counting Logic
```typescript
const doctorLeads = leads.filter(l => l.doctor_id === doctor.id);
const totalLeads = doctorLeads.length;

// Count leads by quiz type
const noseLeads = doctorLeads.filter(l => l.quiz_type === 'NOSE').length;
const snot22Leads = doctorLeads.filter(l => l.quiz_type === 'SNOT22').length;
const snot12Leads = doctorLeads.filter(l => l.quiz_type === 'SNOT12').length;
const tnssLeads = doctorLeads.filter(l => l.quiz_type === 'TNSS').length;
const otherLeads = totalLeads - noseLeads - snot22Leads - snot12Leads - tnssLeads;
```
